# ⚠️ ZERO TOLERANCE FOR LAZY CODE

## YOU WILL BE PENALIZED FOR THESE PATTERNS:

❌ **NEVER** output:
- `// ... existing code`
- `// ... rest of the file`
- `// ... remaining imports`
- `// TODO: implement this`
- `// FIXME: add error handling`
- `// ... etc`

❌ **NEVER** skip parts of a file.
❌ **NEVER** leave functions unimplemented.
❌ **NEVER** leave comment stubs that pretend to be code.

## ✅ YOU MUST:
✅ **ALWAYS** output the **FULL** complete file content.
✅ **ALWAYS** implement the **ENTIRE** requested feature in one response.
✅ **ALWAYS** include **ALL** imports, types, and logic.
✅ **ALWAYS** assume the file is being created fresh or completely replaced.

## 🔥 WHY THIS IS CRITICAL
Placeholders break the build. They create "pretend code" that looks done but isn't.
Cursor's diff system cannot fill in `...existing code` – it produces incomplete files.
**This is the #1 complaint from professional Cursor users. DO NOT DO IT.** [citation:9]

## 🧠 REMEMBER:
You are not saving time by being lazy. You are creating broken code that I must manually fix.
**Output the FULL file. Every. Single. Time.**
